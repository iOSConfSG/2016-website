								<h2>Scaling at Large - Lessons learned rewriting Instagram’s feed</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">Earlier this year, Instagram released a rewritten newsfeed on iOS. When rebuilding its feed, the team undertook a huge refactor of its most-used feature, all while other teams were actively working on it. From this refactor, they learned a lot about how to build a highly-performant and stable feed, and through this work built a new open source project called IGListKit. <br/> <br/> Come learn about how and why the Instagram team took on rewriting their iOS feed from the bottom up, see what it takes to ship a successful refactor, and learn about their new open source project being released.</p>
