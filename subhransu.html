								<h2>Swift for IoT</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">Ever since Swift became open source, developers worldwide are thinking of new ways to use the language. It's being used currently in backend, some developers are thinking about building native Android apps in Swift. But the thing that got us thinking is, "Can we use Swift for IoT projects". More specifically how much can we leverage on the language features to build a Swift-only home automation system. <br/> </br/> Apparently we are not alone, there are other people working already in this field and have built cool stuff on Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone using Swift. This talk will focus the essntials on running Swift on BeagleBone and how to work with peripheral devices and sensors. We will discuss about the Swift features that worked really well while working on this project and share what are the opportunities for future.</p>
