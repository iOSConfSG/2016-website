								<h2>Leveraging Swift's Type System</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">One of the most remarkable qualities of Swift, compared to Objective-C, is its powerful type system. Swift developers have quickly accustomed themselves to the benefits of safer, more expressive APIs. <br/> <br/> However, many of us don’t leverage the type system as much as we could. Types can help us eliminate duplicate code, build APIs that are easy to comprehend and even verify a significant portion of our program’s behavior. <br/> <br/> This talk will explore how we can leverage the power of Swift’s type system in two broad categories: <br/> <br/>1. Program Verification with Types, including a brief discussion on Types vs. Tests <br/>2. Code Sharing with Types, via Protocols & Generics<br/><br/>We will discuss how these ideas can be applied in practice by including examples from a production app with a large code base.</p>
