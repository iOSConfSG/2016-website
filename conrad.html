											Conrad Kramer is one of the iOS developers behind the automation app <a href="https://workflow.is" target="_blank">WorkFlow</a> that won WWDC design award in 2015. He got his start 6 years ago by making software for jailbroken iOS devices and has since used that experience to build apps for the App Store. He has contributed to a few open source projects including <a href="https://github.com/facebook/componentkit" target="_blank">ComponentKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle" target="_blank">Mantle</a>, and has released a few of his own. He enjoys cycling, electronic music, introspection and occasionally, sleeping.</p>

									<h2>Visualizing Graphs in Swift</h2>
								</header>

							<p style="font-size: 85%;">In this talk I will walk through building an interactive graph visualization that doubles as a physics simulation, and I’ll be building it from scratch. I will be writing a version of this demo <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045" target="_blank">https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045</a> in Swift 3. <br/> <br/> Building the force directed graph layout will involve building a quad tree  (yay recursive enums) to efficiently simulate Coulomb’s Law and a custom animator to coordinate the simulation. Finally I will also walk through how this can be embedded in a playground with explanatory markdown to teach the same principles.</p>
